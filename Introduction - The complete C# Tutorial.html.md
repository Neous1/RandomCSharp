# Introduction

++++++++++++   Welcome to this C# tutorial. With the introduction of the .NET framework, Microsoft included a new language called C# (pronounced C Sharp). C# is designed to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language, borrowing key concepts from several other languages, most notably Java. <br>
<br>
C# could theoretically be compiled to machine code, but in real life, it's always used in combination with the .NET framework. Therefore, applications written in C#, requires the .NET framework to be installed on the computer running the application. While the .NET framework makes it possible to use a wide range of languages, C# is sometimes referred to as THE .NET language, perhaps because it was designed together with the framework. <br>
<br>
C# is an Object Oriented language and does not offer global variables or functions. Everything is wrapped in classes, even simple types like int and string, which inherits from the System.Object class. <br>
<br>
In the following chapters, you will be guided through the most important topics about C#.  [Next![>](./Introduction - The complete C# Tutorial_files/bullet_arrow_right.png "Next chapter")](http://csharp.net-tutorials.com/basics/visual-csharp-express/) ï¿½ net-tutorials.com 2006 - 2017
